Traversal Tree

Input : User will first enter the number of elements and then he/she will enter the elements.

Output :  Pre-order, Post-order, In-order of the given array will be displayed.
 
Algorithm: 
Step  1--  Given array will be converted as “binary search tree”.
Step  2— a) For Pre-order traversal
Visit the root node of binary search tree.
Tree is traversed recursively to the leftmost subtree .
Tree is traversed recursively to the rightmost subtree. 

b) For Post-order traversal
Visit the root node of binary search tree.
Tree is traversed recursively to the rightmost subtree 
Tree is traversed recursively to the leftmost subtree


c) For In-order traversal
 Tree is traversed recursively to the Rightmost subtree.
Visit the root node of binary search tree.
Tree is traversed recursively to the leftmost subtree.
